# CC50 CAESAR

Supposedly, Caesar (yes, that Caesar) used to “encrypt” (i.e., reversibly hide) confidential messages by shifting each letter in them some number of places. For example, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, ..., and, grouping alphabetically, Z as A. And then, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar might write IFMMP. Upon receiving these messages from Caesar, the recipients would have to “decipher” them by moving the letters in the opposite direction in the same number of places.

The secrecy of this “cryptosystem” depended solely on Caesar and the recipients knowing one secret, the number of places Caesar had moved his letters (e.g. 1).
